## `Module & Control General`
The role of the module & control group is to develop and implement all class/data structures and functions associated with the simulation being created by the Delineo Disease Modeling initiative. Currently, the module & control group is working on augmenting the functionaity of SynthPops, a module developed by the Institute for Disease Modeling to create generic synthetic populations, to better suit the needs of their simulation. More information can be found at https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/synthpops.
