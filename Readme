Process for making the Visualisation:

Step 1: Use the Places API from Google Maps to get data about the category of a Place
Step 2: Make a Data Frame out of this data and convert to a JSON file(I think)
Step 3: Feed the JSON File to the Map_with_Visualisation.html file and decide what aspects of the data frame it picks
        up to decide the visualisation

Map.html: If you open this file in your browser, you will get a plain google map that you can interact with
Map_with_Visualisation.html: If you open this file in your browser, you will get a map with a earthquake visualisation,
                             which will be changed to our visualisation when we figure out how to get our data into
                             JSON/geoJSON/JSONP format
Data.py: This file will be used to get data from Places API and to make a data frame from that data and change it into
         a JSON/geoJSON/JSONP file.

Note: You will be able to view the Google Maps in the html files only if it is approved for the API Key I generated
      to use this Maps Javascript API from my Gmail account. To do that, when you open this .html file in browser,
      let me know the name the the website that comes up(or the url of the file that opens up in the browser). I will
      give access to that url from my account and then you will be able to view the google maps on the website
